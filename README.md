<h3><u>DHIS2 automatic imporations</u></h3>

This application helps to  automatically import with DHIS2.

The goal is to get all of the required informations from the DHIS2 server first,
then we can manipulate them and send back data to the server.

Note that you need to fill out your credentials.json with your own credentials
for this to work.
